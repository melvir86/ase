This is a live document elaborating on our technology tool selections and the rationale for them.

1. Tool for Sprint meetings (Planning, Review, Daily Scrums - Happens every 3 days as it's a small team)
MS Teams

Rationale: We are all already proficient with MS Teams having used it extensively during our Birkbeck postgrad.
MS Teams also provides us a simple enough way to record meetings so that we can submit them as per the project requirement.
We did consider other tools such as Slack but eventually decided to stick to MS Teams

2. Tool for Product Mgmt (Backlog & Sprint descriptions and planning)
Kanban Flow
Our board URL (https://kanbanflow.com/board/L6rwAHJ)

Rationale: Although other tools such as Trello were recommended by Keith, we already made our decision a week before to
experiment and test out different tools. During our experimentation, we came by Kanban Flow that fit our requirements really well
as we need a simple and convenient way to manage our Product and Sprint backlogs. It also allowed us to add customized swimlanes
so we could customize it fully to the way we work. We have used it for our first Sprint and find it good enough.

3. Tool for managing Code Repository
Github
Our Github Repo (https://github.com/melvir86/ase)

Rationale: We are all very proficient with using Git due to our experience during POP as well as our personal projects.
Git also provided us a secure way of managing our repo and set permissions so that only the 3 of us have commit permissions
to make changes to the repository.
